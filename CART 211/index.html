            <h4>The <em>'Great Man'</em> Theory</h4>
            <p>I think my answer illustrates that the ‘great man theory’ is flawed when applied to this historical context since the creation of the Internet was a community effort spanning across multiple years. The so-called ‘great men’ to whom Internet history is credited, albeit ingenious, were provided sizable financial support that should not be overlooked in order to carry out their ideas.

            <h4>North Turtle Island's Re-Design</h4>
            <p>If North Turtle Island’s government hired me to re-design its network infrastructure, I would propose a partnership between the government and non-profit organisations, who will ensure all local communities’ needs are heard and met. Modelled off the Detroit Free Mesh Network Project, routers would be spread out throughout the region to ensure all communities have access to the Internet. In fact, accessibility and preventing a digital divide would be a priority; The infrastructure’s maintenance would be funded through a progressive tax system in order to ensure all class groups have access. These taxes would also fund the implementation of non-profit educational programs with the intent of developing residents’ technological interests and skills, and therefore incite the development of local tech companies. This would eventually decrease North Turtle Island’s economic and social dependency on the neighbouring country’s own tech companies, and allow the local tech economy to prosper. The government would also put in place laws protecting users’ information and privacy. A collaboration between the government and non-profit organisations, as well as the prioritisation of growing local tech businesses, will prevent the privatisation and monopolisation of the region’s network.

            <h4>Early Internet Artists</h4>
            <p>The sociopolitical context and changes of the 90’s is what prompted internet artists to make art on the internet. For instance, the Internet became an opportunity for artists to escape the commodified and exploited art scene of the 80's. The Internet morphed into a new artistic medium, a broader form of communication that interlaced text, images, and videos in a way that presented endless creative possibilities for net artists. I think that humans’ innate desire to form communities prospered with access to the Internet, as the trade of ideas and sharing of opinions within and between communities could now undergo internationally. For many artists, such as Heath Bunting, this new medium was a way to counter capitalist culture and its role within art communities, publish manifestos, and discuss bureaucracy and institutions freely. 
            </p>
            <h4>What Makes a Successful Artist?</h4>
            <p>I define success for an artist as the ability to generate a reaction from the viewer, and thus, generate a discussion around the artwork. A successful artist can also be defined as one who questions and redefines their understanding of concepts and compels the viewer to do the same. I think Heath Bunting’s Kings Cross Phone-In is a model of my view, as his project uniquely exploited aspects of public space such to disrupt the norm and incite conversation between strangers. 

            </p>
            <h4>My favourite Internet Art</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.bornfight.studio/portfolio">Bornfight Studio’s</a> website is “simple,” but its minimalist appearance is accompanied by unique and enticing animations that entice user interactivity. Joseph Squier’s “urban diary” from 1997 is also one of my favourites in how it collages analogue and digital art to form a personal website. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031016195531/http://www.wefail.com:80/">Wefail</a> is also a favourite of mine because it challenges our traditional understanding of websites in the way it formats the website as a video that the user can skip, fastforward, or go back, rather than using sections or separate web pages.

            <h4>Teaching With Augmented Reality</h4>
            <p>If I were to design an engaging education experience for “Creative Computing & Network Culture” for my students in 2030, I would integrate interactive technologies in-class, provide interactive resources as readings, and implement project-based grading rather than a traditional grading system. During class time, I would like to utilise augmented reality technologies similar to the NASA Cyberiad, since studies have proven XR technologies to be fruitful and effective in higher-level education, to engage my students with concepts that aren’t immediately tangible such as networks and technological abstractions. They could then be explored virtually and thus understood through experience given that grasping all relevant technological terms (and abstractions upon abstractions) can be difficult.  
            </p>
            <h4>Utilizing Interactive Storytelling</h4>
            <p>As for the portion of the course concerning the history of the Internet and network culture, I would provide my students with readings that take on various forms of hyper-media. Ideally, the students would navigate these readings chronologically, and overall, they would form the history of the Internet, in which each branch is a story itself. Modelled off the interactive storytelling depicted by Douglas Adams, if a specific branch of history interests a student, they may choose to interact with it more. To cater to all students, who may each find different media forms more engaging than others, ressources of various formats (texts, videos, hypergrams, hyper-comics) will be available to tell the same story. Therefore, autonomy is returned to students for this portion of the course.  
            </p>
            <h4>I Promise I Won't be a Harsh Grader</h4>
            <p>Testing would be based on projects developed over time that may have a general theme to follow, but overall, that the students may develop with creative freedom all while developing the necessary skills and consolidating the theory covered in the course.

            <h4>Omnicorp & Conkers University</h4>
            <p>I would first develop a partnership between the university and Omnicorp that would ultimately funnel Conker U graduated and interning students to the company. The company would have available positions for students as well as host networking events and workshops connecting Omnicorp developers to the students. The students could then apply what they’ve learnt during their research at the university to innovate new technologies relevant to the company modelled off previous innovations. <br><br>I would also use the 1$ million CAD budget towards grants and scholarships; students conducting research and coming up with new developments that are evaluated to be useful to the company would receive these grants and scholarships to reward their innovation and potentially buy off their innovation so that it will become property of the company. In fact, a deal with the university’s computing lab will be made to make this legally possible and essentially disregard the GNU General Public License granted the student consents to its purchase.

            <h4>Health Isn't Intellectual Property!</h4>
            <p>I would like to help make the vaccine and its distribution available globally. I would first put efforts into raising awareness about the harm of patenting a vaccine during a global health crisis and ideally, companies like Omnicorp would be pressured to release their vaccine research as well as offer the vaccine freely, or at a reduced price suitable for poorer countries. If these efforts aren’t enough, I would resort to ethical hacking in order to anonymously aid other countries in accessing the research, and thus, their fundamental right to healthcare. Similar to the AIDS/HIV crisis in Brazil starting in the early 1980’s in which citizens didn’t have access to treatment due to patent laws and inflated prices, countries who can’t afford purchasing the vaccine research will have free access to it in order to produce generics. Following the path paved by Aaron Swartz, I believe that withholding this information would directly withhold the betterment of society.

            <h4>Addressing Gender-based Wage Gaps</h4>
            <p>If I were a newly hired web designer for a substantial tech company and were faced with this issue, I would first bring the issue up to HR and highlight the fact that a quarter of the company is made up of women. However, it is likely that the response to this ‘revelation’ would merely be some hollow theatrics that wouldn’t lead to real action. Female empowerment and gender equality are topics often addressed and advertised by tech industries, used as a ploy to paint male-driven and male-catered companies as contemporary and progressive – but in practice, gender inequality (amongst other issues) is still a pressing issue that lies in wage gaps, maternity leaves, promotion disparities, and sexual harassment. If the issue is not properly addressed at the company, I would work to make the information public so that the company heads would face both internal and external pressure. In doing so, I would hope to not only bring to light the everpresent disparities in the company, but also push similar companies to erase the taboo culture that’s grown around salaries by making their wages public and addressing their own wage inequalities.

            <h4>Pepsi Advertisement</h4>
            <p>Becoming an influencer with a significant platform entails having a number of (possibly impressionable) people consuming what I decide to put out; Each action I take publicly must be calculated and thought-through because what I choose to post becomes a reflection of myself. The main dilemma with the Pepsi promotion is that if I do choose to subtly advertise their product, the company and its problematic actions become a part of my own image. This would likely discredit any opinions I would have expressed in the past as well as those I express in the future, and thus create an untrusting environment between my audience and my content, especially if my online presence is noticed for my opinions. However, if I donate the earnings I make from the promotion to charities and important social causes, then the pros would outweigh the cons. Similarly to Macklemore, my existing and future content will then reach greater audiences to whom I would continue to express my opinions, and spread awareness and support for social issues even if they may contradict the ad I did with Pepsi. <br><br>This being said, if the consensus is to advertise Pepsi subtly, which I assume is presenting a Pepsi product as though I use it in my everyday life, then I would be contributing to the commodification of my own online presence. Therefore, I wouldn’t take the offer because ultimately, I would view the content I create not as a product and I myself don’t want to become more of a product, especially if that means advertising myself as something that doesn’t align with my values.

            <h4>How Could Network Technology and Digital Media Aid Healthcare?</h4>
            <p>I think access to healthcare is a big issue that faces the world today. The situation in Quebec itself is a big issue that has required attention for years with little real action to respond to its needs. I think digitising access to healthcare for all people to be able to gain quick and better access to information regarding their health as well as their healthcare rights could alleviate the lack of (access to) information. This would help bridge the gap in healthcare access internationally, especially for underdeveloped regions and underrepresented groups. I think that sharing medical data and information would also incite further research globally. Such platforms would allow users to connect with medical experts, but also provide them with the differing perspectives from experts coming from different cultures, traditions, and practices, thus not solely enforcing western practices for instance. 
            </p>
            <h4>Project Development: a For-Profit Process</h4>
            <p>
            I think that funding and demand are two of the major influences on the process that determines the development of digital engineering or creative tech projects. Projects that corporations deem profitable and likely to gain attention of potential investors are prioritised. Although the prospective impact of a project could also influence this decision, importance given the certain issues – social, political, economic – varies per person and class, and larger for-profit corporations are more likely to prioritize profit over pressing issues. I think decisions that could benefit multiple groups should involve the input of outside perspectives and communities in order to ensure an understanding of various contexts that make up a social issue. This would also divert project development to focus on long-term benefits over short-term (financial) ones.

            <h4>Advertisement is my Kryptonite</h4>
            <p>Generally speaking, yes, advertising does work on me. It depends, however, on how the product being sold is advertised to me. I think I am less likely to be influenced by an ad if it is too blatant or annoying, such as popups online, big billboards, or advertisements on Youtube – if anything, these ads make me less inclined to want to be a consumer of their product because they merely disrupt the spaces I’m in. On the other hand, advertisements that are more subtle, notably through product placements or promoted by influencers and creators that I follow online, are more likely to work on me because they're presented in a space that I choose to be in and are usually catered to my taste. These ads are especially efficient when promoted by a person because they subconsciously make me think I could be like these figures that inspire me if I also use these products, despite knowing that those promoting such products aren’t necessarily real consumers of it. 
            </p>
            <h4>Where do my Ideas & Tastes Come From?</h4>
            <p>
                I think a lot of my taste comes from my immediate environment – my family and friends. My taste in fashion and personal style is influenced by my friends to some extent (who in turn, are partly influenced by the media they consume), the books I read and movies and shows I watch are often recommendations, and my ideas and same tastes are further influenced by these books, movies, and shows. 
            </p>
            <h4>How to Free Oneself From the Myth of Personal Freedom</h4>
            <p>
                No, I don’t believe myself to be free. Oftentimes, whenever I think a personal taste, opinion, or idea of mine is truly original and my own, I find out that it was merely a product of the media and products I consume daily – consciously and subconsciously. I personally don’t believe true freedom to be possible under our consumerist culture to which we are both the victims and the upholders.

            <p>If I were in a position in which I had to prevent the formation of a union, all without creating any new permanent running expenses for the company, I would first and foremost try to identify who may be at the root of this. I would then schedule meetings with them to discuss why they would like to unionise and attempt to convince them otherwise. If attempts persist, I would gather all employees to discuss the matter at hand, lay out the cons of a union,, as well as appoint certain trustworthy employees to ensure that the situation stops escalating. If necessary, I would make it clear that further attempts may result in employees’ termination from the company.
